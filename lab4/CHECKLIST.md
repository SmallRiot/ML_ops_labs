# Lab 4 checklist (first person)

## Homework No.4

- [x] I implemented a REST service with `/predict` for model inference.
- [x] I can run the service inside a Docker container.
- [x] I implemented a load testing script with N in {1,2,5,10,20,50}.
- [x] I log response time statistics (avg and quantiles).
- [x] I store the trained model in the repository.
- [x] I document load test results and hardware info in the README.
- [x] I keep the code modular and use CLI arguments.

## Verification flow

- [x] I documented setup and run steps in `lab4/README.md`.
- [x] I documented how to run the load test.
